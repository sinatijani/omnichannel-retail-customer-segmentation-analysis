# Omnichannel Retail Marketing Campaign Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involved a comprehensive statistical analysis aimed at optimizing marketing campaigns for an omnichannel retail business. The primary objective was to extract actionable insights from customer data to enhance campaign effectiveness and drive business growth.

## Key Methodologies and Findings

1.  **Data Cleansing and Preparation:**
    * Utilized Python libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, to perform thorough data cleaning.
    * Addressed data quality issues by removing 201 duplicate records (8.97% of the dataset) and handling outliers within the "Income" variable (0.44% of the dataset).
    * Imputed missing "Income" values using the mean to ensure data completeness for subsequent analysis.

2.  **Descriptive Statistics:**
    * Conducted descriptive statistical analysis to summarize key characteristics of the customer dataset.
    * Calculated measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) for variables such as customer age and income, providing insights into typical customer attributes.
    * Determined measures of variability (quartiles, standard deviation) to understand the distribution and spread of customer data.

3.  **Hypothesis Testing:**
    * Employed hypothesis testing to investigate specific relationships within the data:
        * **Chi-Square Test:** Evaluated the association between customer education level and marital status, finding no statistically significant correlation.
        * **One-way ANOVA:** Assessed the impact of marital status on customer engagement (recency), revealing no significant differences in engagement across marital status groups.
        * **Multiple Linear Regression:** Developed a regression model to predict customer income based on behavioral and engagement metrics, identifying key predictive variables and assessing multicollinearity using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).

4.  **Implications for Marketing Strategy:**
    * The analytical findings provide a foundation for:
        * Developing targeted and personalized marketing campaigns.
        * Optimizing marketing resource allocation to maximize return on investment.
        * Gaining a deeper understanding of customer segmentation and behavior.

## Key Learnings and Skills Demonstrated

* Proficiency in data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.
* Competence in applying descriptive and inferential statistical methods.
* Ability to develop and interpret statistical models, including regression analysis.
* Capacity to translate data-driven insights into actionable business recommendations.
* Effective communication of complex analytical findings.

## Impact

This project demonstrates the ability to utilize data analysis to inform strategic decision-making and drive tangible business outcomes, providing a framework for enhancing omnichannel retail marketing campaign effectiveness.
